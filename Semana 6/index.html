                        <q>My team usually manage about 16 to 17, or 18 patients with diabetes per day,</q>
                        Zilbermint told CTV News. <q>And our numbers increased up to 30 per day.</q>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Zilbermint is an endocrinologist and an associate professor with Johns Hopkins 
                        School of Medicine in Maryland. The sudden change was surprising, he said, and worrying.

                        A diagnosis of diabetes was also a shock to John Kunkel, who lives in Arkansas, 
                        and had just recovered from a serious case of COVID-19 when he discovered his pancreas 
                        had stopped making enough insulin, forcing him into daily blood sugar testing, 
                        and metformin to manage his diabetes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Kunkel tested positive for COVID-19 at the end of June 2020.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He texted his doctor immediately after realizing that he had lost his sense of taste. 
                        By the time he arrived at the doctor’s office, he already had a fever of 101 degrees.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <q>By 7:30 that night I was in the emergency room with 103.5 fever,</q> 
                        he said. <q>So I went from really losing my taste at 11 o'clock, being in 
                        the hospital at night with a very high fever.</q>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        His fever was worryingly high for almost two weeks straight. He was in the 
                        emergency room five times.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In July, things took a turn for the worse during his recovery.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <q>I'll never forget the day,</q> he said. <q>It was July 30 when I had bloodwork done.</q>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When his results came back, it was clear there was a problem with his blood sugar.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <q>So it's like, “hey, you've got diabetes, we've got to start treating it immediately,” 
                        because it was so high,</q> Kunkel said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <q>A lot of it was, you know — why? I didn't have it before. And it was the big question 
                        that all the doctors would give is, they really don't know.”</q>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Doctors around the world are now sharing similar case reports of sudden onset diabetes 
                        after COVID-19 infection, finding that the link is strongest among patients who were 
                        hospitalized with the virus.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <q>We clearly see people without previous diabetes developing diabetes,</q> 
                        Dr. Remi Rabasa-Lhoret, with the Montreal Clinical Research Institute, told CTV News. 
                        <q>It is highly probable that COVID-19 is triggering the disease.</q>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Studies suggest that <a href="https://dom-pubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/dom.14269">
                        up to 14 per cent of COVID-19 patients may develop sudden onset diabetes.</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <q>We've seen this with influenza and other infections […] but the magnitude of what we see with 
                        COVID-19 is above what we're used to,</q> Rabasa-Lhoret said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        People with diabetes are already more at risk of experiencing severe outcomes if they contract 
                        COVID-19, and now the virus may be putting people more at risk of developing diabetes — 
                        a connection that an article in the <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2018688">
                        New England Journal of Medicine</a> described as <q>a bidirectional relationship.</q>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So why is this happening? Doctors and researchers are investigating, but a specific reason 
                        hasn’t been pinpointed yet.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Among the theories is that this could be a side effect of a steroid used to treat COVID-19.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Zilbermint said that patients who experience complications due to COVID-19 frequently receive 
                        a steroid medication called Dexamethasone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <q>[It’s] our standard therapy for those who have low oxygen levels, and the side effect of 
                        this medication is high sugar levels, or diabetes,</q> he said. <q>So it's possible that the 
                        medications they use to treat COVID may also contribute to increased risk of developing diabetes.</q>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Kunkel said he was on a round of steroids for an entire month, and now he’s unsure if this 
                        contributed to his diagnosis.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <q>I had three rounds, so that could have elevated and caused it,</q> he said. 
                        <q>So there's all of these really unknowns.</q>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are also signs that the novel coronavirus itself could affect the body in ways 
                        that would cause them to develop diabetes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <q>There are some suggestions that COVID-19 could go directly in the cells which produce 
                        insulin, in the pancreas, and damage them,</q> Rabasa-Lhoret said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Zilbermint added that the virus may be able to change the way that cells metabolize glucose itself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Acute onset of diabetes was also reported more among patients with SARS a decade ago, he said, 
                        <q>compared to those without the SARS pneumonia, […] which I think is important to mention.</q>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another thought is that perhaps it’s that the infection tips people who are at risk of 
                        developing diabetes into a diagnosis sooner.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <q>It's possible that [a] patient lives with pre-diabetes for many years and didn't know that,</q> 
                        Zilbermint said. <q>Now they have COVID-19 infection, and the infection is pushing them towards developing diabetes.</q>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That’s something Kunkel has considered.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <q>It could be that, OK, I was on the verge of getting diabetes, and COVID-19 actually pushed it over 
                        the edge,</q> he said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some doctors wonder if it’s a new form of diabetes altogether.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In Type 1 diabetes, patients’ immune system destroys beta cells that produce insulin.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, COVID-19 patients who develop diabetes can also exhibit insulin resistance which is found in Type 2 diabetes. 
                        (Insulin resistance is when cells are <q>resistant</q> to the hormone insulin, and as a result can’t use glucose. 
                        The pancreas produces more insulin and blood sugar spikes.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some doctors believe the sudden-onset diabetes after a COVID-19 infection may be a novel condition which 
                        features both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <q>The main question is, is this going to be transient, or is this going to be permanent?</q> 
                        Rabasa-Lhoret said. <q>And on the short term, we don't know.</q>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It’s the questions that haunt patients like Kunkel, as well as the doctors who treat these patients.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But work is being done to figure out what is going on, and how best to treat patients.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <q>A number of endocrinology specialists and diabetes experts around the world are looking into this,</q> 
                        Zilbermint said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <q>For example, my colleagues at the King's College in London and U.K. already established a robust 
                        database where all the researchers, clinicians, doctors can submit the information about their patients 
                        into a global registry.</q>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This <a href="http://covidiab.e-dendrite.com/">new global database</a> will try to collect all the cases 
                        in a bid to understand whether the coronavirus infection truly has yet another nasty side effect.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <q>I'm sure we'll see more research studies coming out of this registry in the coming months,</q> 
                        Zilbermint said.
