                    <p>
                        LONDON -- AstraZeneca reported Monday that its COVID-19 vaccine provided strong protection among adults of all ages in a long-anticipated 
                        U.S. study, a finding that could help rebuild public confidence in the shot around the world and move it a step closer to clearance in the U.S.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the study of 30,000 people, the vaccine was 79 per cent effective at preventing symptomatic cases of COVID-19 -- including in older adults.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There were no severe illnesses or hospitalizations among vaccinated volunteers, compared with five such cases in participants who received dummy 
                        shots -- a small number, but consistent with findings from Britain and other countries that the vaccine protects against the worst of the disease.

                        School of Medicine in Maryland. The sudden change was surprising, he said, and worrying.

                        AstraZeneca also said the study's independent safety monitors found no serious side effects, 
                        including no increased risk of rare blood clots like those identified in Europe, a scare that led 
                        numerous countries to briefly suspend vaccinations last week.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <q>I do hope it puts to bed any doubts about the vaccine efficacy,</q> Mene Pangalos, AstraZeneca's 
                        biopharmaceuticals research chief, told The Associated Press. <q>Overall where the vaccine is being 
                        used, it's been shown to be highly effective. So I hope that the U.S. study now will continue to give 
                        the vaccine some momentum and get it used even further around the world.</q>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The company aims to file an application with the Food and Drug Administration in the coming weeks, 
                        and the government's outside advisers will publicly debate the evidence before the agency makes a decision.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Pangalos said the vaccine could win emergency authorization toward the second half of April. If so, 
                        the company would deliver 30 million doses immediately and an additional 20 million within the first month.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What that will mean for America's vaccination plans is unclear. The Biden administration already projects 
                        there will be enough doses for all adults by the end of May thanks to increasing supplies from the makers of 
                        the three vaccines already in use in the U.S. -- Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Federal officials said they didn't want to prejudge the FDA's review but cast the AstraZeneca findings as a 
                        victory both for the U.S. supply and the global fight against the virus.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <q>There are very many countries in Europe and throughout the world who have already authorized this, so the 
                        fact that a United States-run study has confirmed the efficacy and the safety of this vaccine I think is an 
                        important contribution to global health in general,</q> said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious disease expert.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The AstraZeneca shot, which has been authorized in more than 70 countries, is a pillar of a UN-backed project 
                        known as COVAX that aims to get COVID-19 vaccines to poorer countries.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It has also become a key tool in European countries' efforts to boost their sluggish vaccine rollouts. 
                        That made doubts about the shots especially worrying.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even before the blood clot scare, scientists hoped the U.S. study would clear up some confusion about how 
                        well the vaccine really works. While previous research suggested it was effective in younger populations, 
                        there were questions about how well it protects those over 65, often those most vulnerable to COVID-19.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Also, Britain authorized the vaccine based on partial results from testing in the United Kingdom, Brazil and 
                        South Africa that suggested the shots were about 70% effective. But those results were clouded by a manufacturing 
                        mistake that led some participants to get just a half dose in their first shot.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Stephen Evans, of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said the new data could help allay concerns.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <q>The benefits of these results will mainly be for the rest of the world where confidence in the AZ vaccine has been 
                            eroded, largely by political and media comment,</q> he said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Two-thirds of the volunteers in the U.S. study received the vaccine and the rest dummy shots, and Monday's report 
                        is based on the first 141 COVID-19 cases reported after the second vaccine dose kicked in. AstraZeneca declined to 
                        provide a breakdown of those cases, as it continues to prepare its FDA submission.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But Fauci said the study was careful to include different ages, racial and ethnic minorities, and people with 
                        underlying health conditions, and found <q>comparable efficacy across ethnicity and age.</q>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Dr. Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, said the results were reassuring 
                        but that more details are needed to back up AstraZeneca's claims.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <q>But this should add confidence that the vaccine is doing what it is most needed for,</q> said Hunter, 
                        who was not connected to the study.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the safety front, France, Germany, Italy and other countries have resumed their use of the AstraZeneca 
                        vaccine after the suspension last week to investigate clots. On Thursday, the European Medicines Agency 
                        concluded the vaccine did not raise the overall risk of clots, but could not rule out that it was connected 
                        to two very rare types.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the U.S., as in Britain and Europe, major efforts already are underway to watch for any unexpected problems 
                        as the first vaccines are rolling out. And as the U.S. considers AstraZeneca's vaccine, Fauci said, <q>You can 
                        rest assured that the FDA will put a great deal of scrutiny in every aspect of these data.</q>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The AstraZeneca shot is what scientists call a <q>viral vector</q> vaccine. The shots are made with a harmless 
                        cold virus that normally infects chimpanzees. It acts like a Trojan horse to carry genetic material from the 
                        coronavirus's spike protein into the body. That primes the immune system to fight back if the real virus comes along.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Two other companies, Johnson & Johnson and China's CanSino Biologics, make COVID-19 vaccines using the same 
                        technology but using different cold viruses.
                    </p>
